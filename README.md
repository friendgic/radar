Minimal HTTP Server 
=========================

This is a very minimal http server to serve `html/css/js/json` file.

- No external dependencies!
- Super minimal! no router, no templates!!
- Best if you only need to serve static html/css/js/json :) 

## What do I do with this ?
- Check what's inside server.js if you want to see how to make HTTP server with Node.js (but you don't have to)
- Remix and put your html/css/js/json files in `/public` directory if you want to create static web page :)
